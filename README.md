# Google Play Store Applications Analysis

## Overview

This project involved transforming an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Google Play Store data, initially conducted using Python, into a dynamic and interactive visual dashboard using Tableau. The process included extensive data manipulation to clean and merge the 'Google Play Store Data' and 'User Review' datasets. The merged data was exported as a CSV file and imported into Tableau. Various charts and calculated fields were created in Tableau to enhance insights. The final dashboards are categorized into three main sections—**Applications Analysis**, **Sentiment Analysis**, and **Revenue Analysis**—providing comprehensive insights into different aspects of the Google Play Store apps.

## Applications Analysis

- **Top Genres by Installs:** Tools, action, photography, and entertainment are among the most installed app genres.
- **App Size Groups:** Smaller apps, particularly those below 20 MB, dominate the Play Store.
- **Rating Distribution:** The majority of apps have a rating between 4.0 and 4.5, reflecting a generally positive reception.
- **Types of Applications:** The vast majority of apps (92.37%) are free.
- **Content Rating:** A significant number of apps are rated for 'Everyone' (81.84%), making them accessible to a wide audience.
- **Android Versions Install Count:** The dashboard shows that "4.1 and up" is the most commonly targeted Android version.

## Sentiment Analysis

- **Review Sentiments:** Most app reviews are positive (64.12%), with smaller portions being negative (22.10%) or neutral (13.78%).
- **Sentiments Trend Over Updates:** Positive sentiments have significantly increased over time, particularly in recent years.
- **Sentiment Subjectivity Distribution:** Illustrates the degree to which reviews are subjective or objective.
- **Sentiments across Top Genres:** Reveals that certain categories like entertainment and medical receive more positive feedback.

## Revenue Analysis

- **Top Categories by Revenue:** Lifestyle, family, and game apps generate the highest revenue.
- **Revenue by Content Rating:** Apps rated for 'Everyone' generate the most revenue, followed by teen-rated apps.
- **Revenue by App Size:** Smaller apps (below 20 MB) generate the most revenue, correlating with their higher install counts.
- **Revenue Over Years:** A steep increase in revenue is observed in recent years, particularly in 2017 and 2018.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis showcases the integration of Python for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, resulting in a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing Google Play Store applications. The dashboards provide valuable insights into app performance, user feedback, and revenue trends.
