## Overview

This project involved transforming an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Google Play Store data, initially conducted using Python, into a dynamic and interactive visual dashboard using Tableau. The process included extensive data manipulation to clean and merge the 'Google Play Store Data' and 'User Review' datasets. The merged data was exported as a CSV file and imported into Tableau. Various charts and calculated fields were created in Tableau to enhance insights. The final dashboards are categorized into three main sections, **Applications Analysis**, **Sentiment Analysis** and **Revenue Analysis**, providing comprehensive insights into different aspects of the Google Play Store apps.

# Attributes Description

## Play Store Data

- **Android Ver:** The Android version required to run the app. This is typically specified by the developer to ensure compatibility with the app’s features.

- **App:** The name of the application listed on the Google Play Store.

- **Category:** The category under which the app is listed on the Play Store (e.g., Game, Education, Productivity).

- **Content Rating:** The age rating given to the app, indicating its suitability for different age groups (e.g., Everyone, Teen, Mature 17+).

- **Genres:** Additional genres or subcategories the app falls under, providing more specific details beyond the main category.

- **Last Updated:** The date when the app was last updated on the Play Store, reflecting the app’s maintenance and update frequency.

- **Rating (bin):** A binned version of the app ratings, grouping them into intervals (e.g., 1-2, 2-3, etc.) for easier analysis.

- **Type:** Indicates whether the app is free or paid.

- **App Revenue:** The revenue generated by the app, likely calculated based on its price and number of installs for paid apps.

- **Installs:** The number of times the app has been installed by users.

- **Price:** The cost to download the app. For free apps, this would typically be zero.

- **Rating:** The average user rating for the app, typically on a scale of 1 to 5.

- **Reviews:** The number of reviews the app has received from users.

## User Review Data

- **App (User Review):** The name of the app associated with the user review data.

- **Sentiment:** The overall sentiment of the user reviews, categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Sentiment Polarity (bin):** A binned version of sentiment polarity, grouping them into intervals (e.g., -1 to -0.5, -0.5 to 0, etc.).

- **Sentiment Subjectivity:** A measure of how subjective the review is, on a scale where higher values indicate more personal opinions or feelings.

- **Sentiment Polarity:** A numeric value representing the polarity of the sentiment, with negative values indicating negative sentiment, positive values indicating positive sentiment, and values near zero indicating neutral sentiment.

- **Sentiment Subjectivity:** Another measure related to how subjective or objective the sentiment is, typically ranging from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective).
